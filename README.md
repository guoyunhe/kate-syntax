# Kate Syntax Highlighting

Some improved syntax highlighting for Kate, the KDE advanced text editor. Mainly
syntax for web programming languages.

- Stylesheets
  - CSS
  - LESS
  - SCSS
  - Stylus
- Scripts
  - TypeScript (TODO)
  - JSX (TODO)
  - TSX (TODO)
- HTML Templates
  - Smarty (TODO)
  - Twig (TODO)
  - Blade
  - Jade/Pug

Use PHP as XML generators. It save a lot of efforts. For example, CSS, SaSS and
LESS share a lot of properties; PHP is a superset of HTML.

Syntax highlighting files will be pushed into official Kate repository when they
are ready.
