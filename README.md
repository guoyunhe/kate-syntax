# Kate Syntax Highlighting

Some improved syntax highlighting for Kate, the KDE advanced text editor. Mainly
syntax for web programming languages.

- HTML
- CSS, LESS, SCSS
- JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript
- PHP
  - Smarty
  - Twig
  - Blade

Use PHP as XML generators. It save a lot of efforts. For example, CSS, SaSS and
LESS share a lot of properties; PHP is a superset of HTML.

Syntax highlighting files will be pushed into official Kate repository when they
are ready.
